# Platform current session

- Status: `LEGACY_PHP_SECURITY_CLEANUP_READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`
- Branch: `scope/platform`
- Baseline: `baseline/pre-scope-20260823`
- Current task: Permanently remove the three legacy PHP surfaces and route inquiry administration through the authenticated Next.js `/admin/inquiries` page.
- Verification: Node `22.23.2` / npm `10.9.8`; `npm run workspace:check -- platform` passed ownership, lint, and TypeScript checks.
- Next action: Commit this Platform-owned source unit, create a UTC source-freeze handoff, merge it into `integration/nexyfab`, then add the integration-owned proxy deny rule and regression coverage for `/adminlink/index.php`.
- External blocker: the historical credential must still be rotated at its provider; source deletion does not revoke an already copied secret. Release promotion and Git history rewrite remain `HOLD`.
